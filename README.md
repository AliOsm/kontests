# Kontests
Competitive programming contests schedule, visit it [here](https://kontests.net)

## What is out service?
We bring all running and future contests between your hands <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f450-1f3fc.svg" style="height: 1.3em;"> from many different online judges.

## Why we do this?
We believe we can save your time <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f565.svg" style="height: 1.3em;"> and let you touch <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f448-1f3fc.svg" style="height: 1.3em;"> the information from many different places, in one place.

## How we pay?
We use a free host which is [Heroku](https://heroku.com), so we pay only for the domain till now, but the free host is very weak, it shutdown every 30 minutes if no one visit the site and has only 500MB storage space, so if you want to help up you can donate here <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f60c.svg" style="height: 1.3em;">.

## Who is our team?
For now I'm alone <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f622.svg" style="height: 1.3em;">, but if you want to help, join KONTESTS team now! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f60d.svg" style="height: 1.3em;">, there is a lot of ideas and projects we can build them together and make KONTESTS better than ever.
