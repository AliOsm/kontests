# Kontests
Competitive programming contests schedule, visit it [here](https://kontests.herokuapp.com)

## What is out service?
We bring all running and future contests between your hands from many different online judges.

## Why we do this?
We believe we can save your time and let you touch the information from many different places, in one place.

## How we pay?
We use a free host which is [Heroku](https://heroku.com), so we pay only for the domain till now, but the free host is very weak, it shutdown every 30 minutes if no one visit the site and has only 500MB storage space, so
if you want to help up you can donate here.

## Where are we from?
We are from competitive programming society.

## Who is our team?
For now I'm alone, but if you want to help and be in our KONTESTS team, then come in, there is a lot of ideas and projects we can build above on this service.
